- You can run all the tests in a package by right - clicking and selecting the 'Run Tests in '<package-name''

- To run tests based on tags, edit configurations, delete former ones and select the tag option as the type
of resource to run and add the tag name.
      - If you want to disable tests based on a tag name, add the '!' sign before the name.
      - If you want to run more than one test, add a '&' sign between the tag names

- If you want to run tests with maven, the tests names have to either begin or end with test or tests for the end.
Hence, you either have to rename all your tests or add a configuration to the Maven Surefire plugin section of your pom.xml
file
        <configuration>
                <includes>**/*Test*.java</includes>
        </configuration>

- To run the tests, use  select "Execute maven goal" (the big lowercase m) and type `mvn test -Dtest=<name of class>` or
`mvn test -Dtest=<file path>`.
        - If it's more than one class, separate them with a comma.
        - If it's just a particular method, add a #<name of method>
        - If it's the entire package, use `mvn test -DtestPackage=<package name>`
        - If it's based on tags, use `mvn test -Dgroups=<tag name>`
